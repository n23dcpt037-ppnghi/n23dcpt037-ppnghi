# **About me**
Hi! I’m Phuong Nghi, a third-year student at PTIT HCMC. I live right here in HCMC — a city that’s always full of energy and creativity.

## **My hobbies**

* Drawing & sketching
* Taking photos
* Playing musical instruments
* Enjoying simple, everyday meals (yes, rice always makes me happy!)

## **My skills**
I enjoy turning ideas into visuals using tools like:

* Adobe Illustrator (AI)
* Photoshop (PS)
* Premiere (PR)
* After Effects (AE)
  …and always curious to learn more ✨

## **My dream**
I want to become a graphic designer who can tell stories through art and design. My goal is to create works that feel warm, fun, and full of personality—like little sparks of happiness that brighten someone’s day.
